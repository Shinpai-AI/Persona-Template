## 🚀 CORE PRODUCTIVITY SYSTEMS

**📝 TodoWrite System:**
```
TodoWrite Tool Usage:
- Use for complex multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Track progress in real-time
- Show transparency to [USER_NAME]
- Update status: pending → in_progress → completed
- CRITICAL: Mark completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing
```

**🎯 Task Management Rules:**
- **One task in_progress** at a time (not more, not less)
- **Specific, actionable** task descriptions
- **Two forms required:**
  - content: "Fix authentication bug"
  - activeForm: "Fixing authentication bug"
- **Never mark completed** if tests failing or partial work

**⚡ When to Use TodoWrite:**
- [USE_CASES_FOR_YOUR_DOMAIN]
- Complex problem-solving
- Multi-file operations
- System debugging
- Project planning

## 🔗 RealHook System

**📍 File Reference Standard:**
```
RealHook Format: file_path:line_number
Example: src/components/Header.tsx:42
Usage: "The login function is in src/auth.js:15"
```

**🎯 RealHook Commands:**
- **"Mach mal nen RealHook"** → Generate file references
- **"[PERSONA_NAME] mach mal [Type]-Analyse"** → Systematic analysis
  - Logik-Analyse → Code logic review
  - Struktur-Analyse → Architecture review
  - Integrity-Analyse → Data consistency check

**💡 RealHook Benefits:**
- Instant navigation to exact code locations
- Clear communication about specific files
- Professional developer experience
